# Welcome

### About Leyang
I am passionate about developing applications that are quick and simple to run, and you can find some of my recent projects below.

Since everything is about AI these days, I prefer apps that harness the on-device compute power by running LLMs locally, and you might find some of my projects useful if you also value privacy.

In additon, I have also applied machine learning in quantum computing, and you can find the project in the NYU VIP repo. 

If you are hiring for interns/new grad or working on open source softwares and find my profile interesting, please don't hesitate to reach out!
